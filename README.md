This project was about developing a creative quantitative return prediction strategy strategy on a portfolio of stocks and given a vast amount of quantitative data
as well as text data in the form of 10Q and 10K filings. The text data was analized using the finbert model to classify the sentiment expressed in the text, generating a quantitative
signal to be used in the model. The model we used worked by first seperating each rebalancing period into a macro-econimic regime, training an xgboost classifyer on each 
regime given the quantitative factors and signals generated by the finbert model, and trying to predict the return of the stock over the next month.
These xgboost classifyers were deemed the regimes 'experts'. The predictions generated by our model are created by polling each expert on their prediction of the stocks return over the next month, and 
then weighting their responses by the probability we are within the experts regime. 

Some of the code used to initialize the data, and train the experts are available in the code provided.
